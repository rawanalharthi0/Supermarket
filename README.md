# Supermarket

The objective of this project is analyzes supermarket transaction data to discover associations between frequently bought products using the Apriori algorithm. Implemented in Python, it utilizes libraries like pandas for data manipulation, seaborn and matplotlib for visualization, and mlxtend for the Apriori algorithm and association rules generation.

The Apriori algorithm is applied with a minimum support threshold of 2% to find frequent itemsets, and association rules are generated with a lift threshold of 0.5, highlighting significant item relationships. These insights can guide strategic decisions on product placement and promotional bundling to enhance cross-selling opportunities.
